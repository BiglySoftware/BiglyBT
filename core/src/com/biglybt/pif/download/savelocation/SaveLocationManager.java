/**
 * Plugins which want to control the logic of where the default save location
 * for downloads (including for <tt>on-completion</tt> and <tt>on-removal</tt>
 * behaviour) can implement this class and register it through the
 * {@link DownloadManager#setSaveLocationManager(SaveLocationManager)}.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * Each method here returns a {@link SaveLocationChange} object, which contains
 * instructions which allows both the download and the torrent to be moved and
 * renamed.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * The methods here take two arguments - <tt>for_move</tt> and <tt>on_event</tt>.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>When events happen to downloads (like the download being completed or removed),
 *   both of these values will be <tt>true</tt>.
 * <li>When something is trying to update the logical location for the download,
 *   <tt>for_move</tt> will be <tt>true</tt>, while <tt>on_event</tt> will be false.
 * <li>When something is trying to determine all the places where existing data
 *   files might exist, both values will be <tt>false</tt>.
 * </ul>
 *
 * If <tt>for_move</tt> is <tt>false</tt>, any checks normally performed on a download
 * to see if it is applicable or not (to be managed by this object) should not be applied
 * here.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> This interface is intended to be implemented by plugins.</p>
