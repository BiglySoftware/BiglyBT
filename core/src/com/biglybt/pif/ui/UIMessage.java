/**
 * This interface provides a mechanism to display a message to the user,
 * potentially to ask the user a question.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * There are four main elements to set:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the <i>message</i> type - defaults to <tt>MSG_NONE</tt>.
 *   <li>the <i>input</i> type - defaults to <tt>INPUT_OK</tt>.
 *   <li>the message title.
 *   <li>the message text.
 * </ul>
 *
 * In the case of the main SWT interface, the use of this object will present
 * a message box to a user. The message type indicates what sort of icon to display,
 * the input type indicates what buttons are present, the message title is the message
 * box title and the message text is the main message to be displayed.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * There are various methods which have a <tt>setXXX</tt> and <tt>setLocalisedXXX</tt>
 * counterparts. The <tt>setXXX</tt> methods will attempt to translate the given
 * string to a localised representation of it - the <tt>setLocalisedXXX</tt> method
 * will assume that the localisation has already been done, and leave it intact.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> Only for implementation by Azureus, not plugins.</p>
